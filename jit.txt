JIT(JUST-IN-TIME):
                  JIT(just-in-time) compiles parts of the byte code that have similar functionality at the same time and hence reduces the amount of                   time needed for compilation.
                  Byte code:it is compiled format for java programs.
                  JIT compiler improves the performance of java applications at run time,also improves performance of java programms.
                  It requires processor time and memory usage.
                  JIT compiler runs after the programme has started and compiles the code.
                  JIT compiler access to dynamic run time environment where as other standard compilers wont.
                  It is often used with interpreted code to convert it to machine language.
                  JIT is a part of JVM(java virtual machine).
                  JVM:JVM is responsible to execute program line by line.
